# overcoming-catastrophic
A simple implementation of "Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks" in Keras. Compared to other repositories, the code is easier to read. The pervious task is classification on original Mnist dataset and the current task is classification on random permutation pixels Mnist dataset.

One possible result is as follow:

Any advice is welcomed!
